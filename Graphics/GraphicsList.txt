The original Space Invaders game is an array of enemies. There are 5 different enemy types laid out
in rows of eleven each. There is one Bonus enemy that occasionally flies back and forth. There are
four barriers to protect the player, and a player graphic as well as the player and enemy "bullet"
graphics.

Graphics we have provided thus far:
start menu screen - background1.png
gameplay intro screen - background2.png
enemy type 1 - prof1.png
enemy type 2 - prof2.png
enemy type 3 - prof5.png
player type - student.png
barrier - desk.png
2 bullet types: chalk.png, pencil.png

This list is still in progress. Backbone can consult us if they needed anything specific or need to
make changes.
